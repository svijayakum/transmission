## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to determine the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon. Specifical we want to determine if a manual vs an automatic transmision gives better gas milage.  If so, we will quantify the MPG difference between the two engins.
For this analysis we will be using simple and multi regression along with exploratory analysis to answer the required question.
